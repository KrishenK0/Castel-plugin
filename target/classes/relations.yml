# A guild can have these types of relation with another guild: Neutral, Enemy, Truce, Ally and Nation
# Let's say nation A is allies with nation B.
# If A who requested to be allies with nation B accepts or declines B relation terms, the relation attributes from B will be used.
# For example if nation A wants to build in nation B land, and nation A has build attribute but nation B doesn't, it'll listen to nation Bs attributes.
# Guild Allies, truces and enemies have more priority. If A has guild a and B has guild b, and a is allies with b,
# then it'll listen to relation attributes of allies in b regardless of their nation's relation. If a and b are both in the
# same nation their relation will always be "Nation" regardless of the guild's relation.

# Relation request to a nation or a guild.
request-expiration: 1 day

# If guilds relations should be checked when
# interacting with a guild that is not in the same nation.
prioritize-guild-relations: true

# Allow guilds to have separate relations with guilds that are in their nation?
# If you use this, it'll destroy the whole purpose of nation relations.

# The PvP mode of the plugin. Needs a restart to be changed due to performance issues.
# disabled - The plugin doesn't do anything.
# disallowed - Don't allow anyone to PvP. This is mostly useful only when relational pvp types are enabled.
# normal - Players can PvP anywhere based on their relation attributes.
# claimed - Players can only PvP inside of claimed lands based on their relation attributes.
# unclaimed - Players can only PvP outside of claimed lands based on their relation attributes.
# masswar - Players can only pvp anywhere during masswars.
# territory - Players can pvp if both of them are not in their own or allies guild lands.
#    that means player X is only protected if he is in his own claimed land (or an ally). Not when he's in an unclaimed land or a neutral, truce or enemy land.
#    "Allies" in this context refers to any relation with ceasefire attribute.
# relational - Allows you to configure the PvP mode of relations individually.
# Note: When using the claimed/unclaimed options, if one player is a claimed land and the other is in an unclaimed land, they cannot PvP.
# Note: If one of the players is invading any land this option acts like "normal"
pvp: normal

# Only apply guild relations if both parties agree on that specific relation attribute. Meaning that
# the attribute will only take effects if they both enabled that attribute for their relation in guild settings.
# Requires a server restart to be applied.
# If set to false, only the receiving end's relation attributes will be taken into account.
# What that means is, if you're trying to attack a player from a guild with their ceasefire attribute set to false
# but your guild has the ceasefire attribute for the relation set to true, your members will not be able to attack the
# guild, but that guild will be able to attack your members. That doesn't sound like something you'd want in most cases.
agreements: true

# Forces survival mode when players enter another land
# unless they have CEASEFIRE and TURRET_CEASEFIRE attributes with that guild
# or have the guilds.land.bypass.creative permission.
# Note that this does not disable their fly for their safety.
force-survival-mode: true

# auto-revoke: If a guild declares that they no longer wish to be in a relation with the
#              other guild, the other guild will automatically have this relation revoked as well.
# ceasefire: Members of the two guilds cannot PvP each other.
# donate: Guilds can donate resource points to each other clicking their nexus. Note that they'll still be able to use /k donate
# build: Guilds can build in each others lands, however you can't touch any turrets or structures.
# invade: If guilds can invade each other.
# interact: Guilds can interact and open chests, enchantment tables and other containers.
# use: Guilds can use buttons, open doors and use pressure plates.
# home: Allow players to teleport to home of these guilds using /k home <guild>
# manage: Guilds can remove and place turrets and structures in your land.
#         Note that the placed turrets/structures will be for the guild that owns that land.
# limit: How many guilds can a single guild have this type of relation with? Set to 0 for unlimited.
# effects: List of potion effects activated when in these lands.
# customizable: This merely manages the data saved, so it applies after a server restart.
#               To disable it completely, remove it from the Nexus Settings GUI. The players will
#               keep their relation data until the server is restarted if you keep the GUI.
#               Note that NOT specifiying this option defaults to true
# pvp: Only works if the main PvP mode option is set to "relational", this accepts all the same options
#      as the main PvP mode. This also requires a restart.
